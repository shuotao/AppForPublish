Why
● LLMs have vast (but static) world knowledge that only updates when we
retrain
● To build fully autonomous systems we need robust ways to feed dynamic data
in

What’s the weather today
Who’s president
What’s the price of Bitcoin
Who’s the narrator in Nike’s latest ad campaign

● RAG and tool-calling are the best answer we have today

Basics
● Model Context Protocol
○ Open protocol that allows systems to provide context to AI models in a
manner generalizable across integrations
■ In English: standard format for exposing tools to LLMs
● History: in the distant past pre-November 2024 when MCP was introduced…

Basics
●

MCP
○ Does away with the need to build M x N connectors from LLM host/agent to
underlying tool
■ Don’t need to reimplement auth, error handling, rate-limiting, etc
■ Enforces consistent output format using JSON-RPC
○ Extends from Language Server Protocols
■ Allows for proactive agentic workflows rather than purely reactive ones as in
LSP
○ Integrating with tools goes from M x N →M + N connectors

MCP A Bit Deeper
● Terminology
○
○
○
○

Host: Cursor, Claude Desktop
MCP Client: Library embedded on host (stateful session per server)
MCP Server: Lightweight wrapper in front of a tool
Tool: Callable function (could be data source, API)

● Flow
○
○
○
○
○

Client calls tools/list to MCP server (what can you do?)
Server returns JSON describing each tool (name, summary, JSON schema)
Host injects that JSON into model’s context
User prompt triggers model, emitting a structured tool call
MCP server executes and conversation resumes

● MCP provides stdio and SSE transport layer

Limitations
● Agents don’t handle many tools very well today
● APIs eat up your context window quickly
● Design APIs to be AI-native rather that rigid
